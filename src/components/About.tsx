      <p>
        I'm a full stack developer who enjoys turning ideas into scalable, resilient software. Over the years, I've shipped
        production systems with React/Next.js on the front end and Node.js services on the back â€” containerized with Docker
        and deployed to AWS. I adopt AI tools pragmatically: AI agents help me generate and evolve tests, while Cursor speeds
        up implementation without compromising clarity, patterns, or maintainability. My approach is concise, collaborative,
        and outcome-driven.
